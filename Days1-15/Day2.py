# Instructions
# If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip.
# Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
# Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60
# Thus everyone's share of the total bill is $30.00 plus a $3.60 tip.
# Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª
# Example Input
# Welcome to the tip calculator!
# What was the total bill? $124.56
# How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? 12
# How many people to split the bill? 7
#Each person should pay: $19.93
#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
# print("Welcome to the tip calculator!")
# amt = float(input("What was the total bill? $"))
# tip = int(input("How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? "))
# pplCount = int(input("How many people to split the bill? "))

# perPay = (amt/pplCount)
# perPayNTip = round((perPay + perPay*tip/100),2)
# print(f"Each person should pay: {perPayNTip}")
